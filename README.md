**What is Robonomics?** | Robonomics is an open-source platform for IoT applications. We support a new generation of internet technologies (web3) that implements the exchange of technical and economic information in the form of atomic transactions between user applications, IoT services, and complex robotics. | @ensrationis
**Robonomics Connectivity** | For the developersâ€™ convenience, Robonomics contains a set of software for connecting: IoT devices using the HTTP/MQTT protocol, complex robotic systems using the Robot Operating System (ROS). | @vourhey
**Decentralized Cloud infrastructure for IoT** | Robonomics Web Services (RWS) is the basic infrastructural service for Robotics and IoT on top of Robonomics Parachain and IPFS. | @ensrationis
**Digital Twins on Blockchain** | Blockchain enables the shared single version of the truth as to the state of these things across their life cycles and associated business events.* Robonomics Parachain provides an opportunity to create a model of a digital twin and update its state every 6 seconds. | @vourhey
**App Store for Robotics** | Companies that design and manufacture IoT-connected products and equipment should adopt a flexible digital twin delivery model to lower barriers to adoption, such as offering digital twins via marketplaces, rather than only offering digital twins via their own, proprietary, delivery model. | @kap2fox
**Robonomics Parachain overview** | For over a two years, core developers have been developing Robonomics, a Substrate-based chain designed to control robotic and IoT devices. In May 2019, the Robonomics team finished their first tests of Cumulus and plan to launch this chain as a Kusama parachain as soon as this is possible. The Robonomics parachain will allow the community to launch industrial manipulators, collect telemetry from sensors and create routes for autopilot drones using transactions.  | @akru


## Master classes 

Name | Description | Main contributor
-----|-------------|-----------------
**How To Build on Robonomics** | Step by step master class where you will see how to build IoT application on Robonomics in one day. | @ensrationis
**Robonomics Substrate Framework** | Practical overview of https://github.com/airalab/robonomics, launch your own substrate blockchain for IoT | @akru
**Robonomics io** | Especially to make hardware interaction easy we introduce robonomics_io crate. This crate implements two kinds of devices: source - device that intended to read a data and sink - device that intended to write data. This approach suits the pipelines paradigm well and implemented in Robonomics CLI as io subcommand. | @akru
**Connect Digital Twins With Your Services** | Using a prepared digital twin template, or by developing and publishing your own, you can build an application to provide services to robots. Get acquainted with the general scheme of this process, after that we suggest using the tools from the Robonomics platform, with which you can launch your service. | @vourhey
**Build Dapp for End Users** | Using Robonomics.js, learn how to interact via dapp with digital twins of devices. Build IoT applications to transfer telemetry from devices to users, and also provide the ability to launch, for example, a robot vacuum cleaner using the Robonomics decentralized cloud | @vol4tim && @positivecrash
